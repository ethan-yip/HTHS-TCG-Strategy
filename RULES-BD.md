# Rules Breakdown
### Setup
- Deck of 25-35 cards.
> You should really just have 35 cards. The more cards prevents the case for the "lose by default" rule.
- Shuffle and draw 5 cards to start the game.
> I'm assuming same rule as PKM TCG --> one prize card if no "teacher" cards in deck. Try to build a starting deck with just a normal type of starter.
- Flip coin for order, 2 teacher cards.
> Starter teacher card - dormant --> don't put any legendary or main deck surrounding.
- 3 prize cards
> this is why you should have 3-4 legendaries, if 3 are in the prize cards, literally womp womp.

### Turn Movements
- Draw a card.
> Maintain 5-6 cards in hand for mobility. If you have a bunch of teacher cards, then you could technically get rid via cycling.
- Add teacher cards to roster
> Might not need to maintain hand size.
- Roster to classroom
> any amount, thus need to max all teachers in rosters if needed be
